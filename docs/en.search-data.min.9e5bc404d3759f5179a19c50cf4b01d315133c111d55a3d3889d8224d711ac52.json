It not only demonstrates the organization\u0026rsquo;s commitment to continuous improvement but also engages stakeholders in the process of enhancing the AI system, ensuring that it remains aligned with user needs and expectations.\nSub Practices # Maintain a comprehensive record of measurable performance changes, including the specific metrics that have been affected, the magnitude of the changes, and the relevant time frames.\nDocument the findings from correlations between performance changes and context-relevant risks or trustworthiness characteristics.\nShare this documentation with relevant stakeholders to promote transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.\nMeasure 4.3.5. Continuously Monitor and Adapt Performance Monitoring. # Regular monitoring of field data and consultations with AI actors is crucial for staying abreast of new trends, patterns, and emerging risks that may influence the performance of AI systems. This ongoing surveillance allows organizations to detect shifts in system performance or user interaction early, enabling timely adjustments to address potential issues. By keeping a finger on the pulse of how AI systems operate in real-world conditions and how they are perceived by users, organizations can proactively manage risks and ensure that AI systems continue to meet performance standards and user expectations.\nAdapting data collection and analysis methodologies in response to emerging trends is essential for maintaining an accurate and nuanced understanding of AI system performance. As new patterns are identified and the operational context evolves, refining these methodologies ensures that performance monitoring remains effective and relevant. Additionally, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement in performance monitoring encourages all stakeholders involved in the AI lifecycle to contribute to and engage with the process of optimizing AI system performance. This culture not only promotes excellence in AI development and deployment but also ensures that AI systems remain effective and trustworthy over time.\nSub Practices # Regularly monitor field data and consultations with AI actors to identify new trends, patterns, and potential risks that may affect performance.\nAdapt data collection and analysis methodologies as needed to capture emerging trends and refine understanding of performance dynamics.\nFoster a culture of continuous learning and improvement in performance monitoring throughout the AI lifecycle.\nMeasure 4.3.6. Promote Evidence-Based Performance Improvement. # Utilizing identified correlations between context-relevant risks, trustworthiness characteristics, and performance metrics is critical for guiding the development of targeted performance improvement initiatives. By understanding how specific risks and characteristics impact AI system performance, organizations can design interventions that directly address these underlying factors, leading to more effective and sustainable improvements. This evidence-based approach ensures that performance enhancement efforts are grounded in a thorough understanding of the AI system\u0026rsquo;s operational dynamics and the challenges it faces in various deployment contexts.\nPrioritizing evidence-based interventions that tackle the root causes of performance issues fosters a proactive rather than merely reactive approach to performance management. This strategy emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing the fundamental factors that contribute to performance declines, ensuring that interventions lead to lasting improvements. By making performance improvement a central goal of AI development and deployment processes, organizations commit to delivering AI systems that not only achieve technical excellence but also consistently meet or exceed stakeholder expectations, thereby maximizing the value and impact of AI technologies.\nSub Practices # Employ the identified correlations between context-relevant risks, trustworthiness characteristics, and performance to guide the development of targeted performance improvement initiatives.\nPrioritize evidence-based interventions that address the root causes of performance issues, rather than relying solely on reactive mitigation strategies.\nMake performance improvement a core objective of AI development and deployment, ensuring that AI systems consistently deliver value and meet the needs of stakeholders.\nMeasure 4.3 Suggested Work Products # Performance Trends Report - A comprehensive document that details the performance metrics analyzed over time, highlighting areas of improvement and concern.

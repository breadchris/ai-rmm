</h3>
<p>Engaging AI actors and affected communities in assessments is crucial for gaining diverse perspectives and insights into the AI system&rsquo;s impacts and effectiveness. By involving AI actors, such as developers, researchers, and policymakers, organizations can leverage their expertise to evaluate the system&rsquo;s performance and identify potential risks or opportunities for improvement. Similarly, consulting with affected communities allows for understanding their unique needs, concerns, and experiences with the AI system, ensuring that assessments consider their perspectives and prioritize their well-being.</p>
<p>Involving AI actors external to the development team, such as researchers, ethicists, and industry experts, brings diverse perspectives to assessing the AI system&rsquo;s trustworthiness and potential impacts. Consulting with representatives of affected communities, who may face unique vulnerabilities from the AI system&rsquo;s decisions or outputs, ensures their voices are heard and their concerns addressed. Establishing mechanisms for open and respectful engagement with AI actors and affected communities prioritizes their perspectives, fostering collaboration and trust in the assessment process.</p>

<p>Adapting the level of involvement in assessments to match organizational risk tolerance involves customizing the engagement of internal and external stakeholders based on the perceived risks and potential impacts of the AI system. This tailored approach ensures that the right experts and stakeholders are consulted to provide insights and perspectives aligned with the organization&rsquo;s risk management strategy. By calibrating the degree of involvement according to risk tolerance levels, organizations can effectively manage and mitigate risks while optimizing resources and expertise.</p>
<p>Prioritizing the involvement of external experts and stakeholders based on the organization&rsquo;s risk tolerance and the perceived severity of AI risks associated with the system entails tailoring the level of engagement to match the specific risk profiles. This tailored approach ensures that resources are allocated effectively, with more extensive involvement for AI systems with higher-risk profiles and selective engagement for those with lower-risk profiles. By calibrating involvement based on risk tolerance levels, organizations can optimize the assessment process while effectively managing potential risks and impacts.</p>

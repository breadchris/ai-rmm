  <a class="anchor" href="#measure-271-establish-a-security-and-resilience-evaluation-framework">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Establishing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the security and resilience of AI systems is essential in safeguarding against potential threats and vulnerabilities. This framework should include a systematic approach for identifying and assessing security risks, along with strategies for their mitigation. By categorizing risks based on their severity, likelihood, and potential impact, the framework allows for a prioritized response to threats, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to address the most critical concerns first. This structured approach to security evaluation is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the AI system, its data, and the protection of its users.</p>
<p>Defining clear criteria for residual security risks is pivotal within this evaluation framework. It aids in determining the acceptability of remaining risks after mitigation efforts and whether additional measures are needed. This process ensures that the deployment of the AI system does not exceed the organization&rsquo;s risk tolerance and that the system can operate securely even in the face of evolving threats. By continuously monitoring and adjusting these criteria based on actual system performance and emerging threats, organizations can maintain a dynamic and effective security posture that adapts to new challenges.</p>

<p>Developing precise security and resilience metrics is fundamental to quantitatively and qualitatively assessing an AI system&rsquo;s robustness against cyber threats and its capability to maintain functionality under adverse conditions. These metrics should encompass the system&rsquo;s effectiveness in safeguarding data and code from unauthorized access or alterations, its proficiency in identifying and neutralizing malicious activities, and its general resilience against disruptions. By establishing these metrics, organizations can create a measurable framework to evaluate the security posture of their AI systems, ensuring a systematic approach to security that aligns with best practices and industry standards.</p>
<p>Setting well-defined thresholds for each security metric is crucial in determining the AI system&rsquo;s compliance with the organization&rsquo;s predefined security standards and risk tolerance levels. These thresholds act as benchmarks for acceptable security performance, guiding the decision-making process regarding the system&rsquo;s deployment and operation. Should a metric fall below its threshold, it signals a need for immediate action to enhance the system&rsquo;s security measures. This structured approach to security evaluation ensures that the AI system&rsquo;s defenses remain effective and robust, capable of withstanding evolving cyber threats while maintaining operational integrity.</p>
